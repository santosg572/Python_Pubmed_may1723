    "abstract": "On-going, large-scale neuroimaging initiatives can aid in uncovering neurobiological causes and correlates of poor mental health, disease pathology, and many other important conditions. As projects grow in scale with hundreds, even thousands, of individual participants and scans collected, quantification of brain structures by automated algorithms is becoming the only truly tractable approach. Here, we assessed the spatial and numerical reliability for newly deployed automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei in FreeSurfer 7. In a sample of participants with repeated structural imaging scans (N\u2009=\u2009928), we found numerical reliability (as assessed by intraclass correlations, ICCs) was reasonable. Approximately 95% of hippocampal subfields had \"excellent\" numerical reliability (ICCs\u2009\u2265\u20090.90), while only 67% of amygdala subnuclei met this same threshold. In terms of spatial reliability, 58% of hippocampal subfields and 44% of amygdala subnuclei had Dice coefficients\u2009\u2265\u20090.70. Notably, multiple regions had poor numerical and/or spatial reliability. We also examined correlations between spatial reliability and person-level factors (e.g., participant age; T1 image quality). Both sex and image scan quality were related to variations in spatial reliability metrics. Examined collectively, our work suggests caution should be exercised for a few hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei with more variable reliability.",

    "abstract": "Automatic neuroimaging processing tools provide convenient and systematic methods for extracting features from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. One tool, FreeSurfer, provides an easy-to-use pipeline to extract cortical and subcortical morphometric measures. There have been over 25 stable releases of FreeSurfer, with different versions used across published works. The reliability and compatibility of regional morphometric metrics derived from the most recent version releases have yet to be empirically assessed. Here, we used test-retest data from three public data sets to determine within-version reliability and between-version compatibility across 42 regional outputs from FreeSurfer versions 7.1, 6.0, and 5.3. Cortical thickness from v7.1 was less compatible with that of older versions, particularly along the cingulate gyrus, where the lowest version compatibility was observed (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.37-0.61). Surface area of the temporal pole, frontal pole, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, also showed low to moderate version compatibility. We confirm low compatibility between v6.0 and v5.3 of pallidum and putamen volumes, while those from v7.1 were compatible with v6.0. Replication in an independent sample showed largely similar results for measures of surface area and subcortical volumes, but had lower overall regional thickness reliability and compatibility. Batch effect correction may adjust for some inter-version effects when most sites are run with one version, but results vary when more sites are run with different versions. Age associations in a quality controlled independent sample (N\u00a0=\u2009106) revealed version differences in results of downstream statistical analysis. We provide a reference to highlight the regional metrics that may yield recent version-related inconsistencies in published findings.

    "abstract": "In this study, we intend to determine the correlation between the thickness of the cerebral cortex and the severity of the cognitive disorder in Alzheimer disease (AD).\nA total of 20 (14 women and 6 men) patients diagnosed with AD with a Mean age of 72.95 years, and 10 (7 women and 3 men) cognitively normal (CN) subjects with a Mean age of 70.50 years were included in the study. Of the AD patient and CN subjects, 70% were female, and 30% were male. All individuals underwent 1.5 T Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI scanning protocol included 3D MPRAGE (3D-T1W) sequence. All images were analyzed using Freesurfer v5.3, and then the brain cortical thickness in 7 cortical areas (inferior temporal, middle temporal, superior temporal, parahippocampal, pars triangularis, rostral middle frontal, and superior frontal) was calculated.\nThe analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to compare the mean thickness of each region between the patient and the control group. There was a significant difference in the mean cortical thickness in all regions. In all cases, the mean cortical thickness in CN subjects was greater than in AD patients. However, the mean thickness of pars triangularis left hand in CN subjects was not significantly greater than that in AD patients. The receiver operating characteristic system (ROC) was designed to evaluate the predictive power of the patients and the healthy people. We have selected a thousand cut-off points from 1.5 to 3.5 mm for cortical thickness. When the cut-off points were within 2.276878-2.299680 mm in the left hemisphere, Youden's index was maximum. The sensitivity and specificity, in this case, were 80%. Also, when the cut-off points were within the range of 2.263278-2.282278 mm in the right hemisphere, the sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 80%, respectively.\nThis study demonstrates the importance of quantifying the cortical thickness changes in the early diagnosis of AD. In addition, examining the pattern of changes and quantifying the reduction in the thickness of the cortex is a crucial tool for displaying the local and global atrophy of the brain. Also, this pattern can be used as an alternative marker for the diagnosis of dementia. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report finding on the cortical thickness that would help the clinician have a better differential diagnosis. Also, this study has checked the possibility of early diagnosis of the disease.\nThe correlation between the thickness of cerebral cortex and the severity of cognitive disorder in Alzheimer's disease was determined.The cortical thickness change is an important factor in early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease.The pattern of reduction in the thickness changes is a crucial tool for displaying the local and global atrophy of the brain.\nThe neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fast-growing epidemic in aging populations worldwide. In 2050, one new case of AD is estimated to increase up to every 33 seconds. So the diagnosis of AD in the early stage considerably decreases the progress of dementia and helps identify a correct treatment approach. The cortical thickness measured by structural neuroimaging has received a significant surrogate biomarker that could provide powerful tools for the early diagnosis of AD. Since the sensitivity and specificity of MRI are higher, it offers essential advantages for identifying brain atrophy patterns. The manual cortical thickness measurement methods are time-consuming and require experienced anatomists compared with automated methods. In this regard, Freesurfer software, which is a freely available program and provides information for quantifying the functional and structural features of the brain, is used. The current study demonstrates examining the pattern of changes and quantifying the reduction in the thickness of the cortex. This can also be used as an alternative marker for the early diagnosis of dementia using cortical thickness measurment that would help the physicians.",

    "conclusions": "This study demonstrates the importance of quantifying the cortical thickness changes in the early diagnosis of AD. In addition, examining the pattern of changes and quantifying the reduction in the thickness of the cortex is a crucial tool for displaying the local and global atrophy of the brain. Also, this pattern can be used as an alternative marker for the diagnosis of dementia. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report finding on the cortical thickness that would help the clinician have a better differential diagnosis. Also, this study has checked the possibility of early diagnosis of the disease.",

    "results": "The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to compare the mean thickness of each region between the patient and the control group. There was a significant difference in the mean cortical thickness in all regions. In all cases, the mean cortical thickness in CN subjects was greater than in AD patients. However, the mean thickness of pars triangularis left hand in CN subjects was not significantly greater than that in AD patients. The receiver operating characteristic system (ROC) was designed to evaluate the predictive power of the patients and the healthy people. We have selected a thousand cut-off points from 1.5 to 3.5 mm for cortical thickness. When the cut-off points were within 2.276878-2.299680 mm in the left hemisphere, Youden's index was maximum. The sensitivity and specificity, in this case, were 80%. Also, when the cut-off points were within the range of 2.263278-2.282278 mm in the right hemisphere, the sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 80%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging hardware and methodologies allow for promoting the cortical morphometry with submillimeter spatial resolution. In this paper, we generated 3D self-enhanced high-resolution (HR) MRI imaging, by adapting 1 deep learning architecture, and 3 standard pipelines, FreeSurfer, MaCRUISE, and BrainSuite, have been collectively employed to evaluate the cortical thickness. We systematically investigated the differences in cortical thickness estimation for MRI sequences at multiresolution homologously originated from the native image. It has been revealed that there systematically exhibited the preferences in determining both inner and outer cortical surfaces at higher resolution, yielding most deeper cortical surface placements toward GM/WM or GM/CSF boundaries, which directs a consistent reduction tendency of mean cortical thickness estimation; on the contrary, the lower resolution data will most probably provide a more coarse and rough evaluation in cortical surface reconstruction, resulting in a relatively thicker estimation. Although the differences of cortical thickness estimation at the diverse spatial resolution varied with one another, almost all led to roughly one-sixth to one-fifth significant reduction across the entire brain at the HR, independent to the pipelines we applied, which emphasizes on generally coherent improved accuracy in a data-independent manner and endeavors to cost-efficiency with quantitative opportunities.",

MRI images of 417 healthy individuals were analyzed. TRT reliability was performed on 60 participants. The mean CT of the parcels of the Desikan-Killiany atlas were calculated both in FS and CAT12. Linear mixed model was performed to compare the two methods and the TRT reliability, and paired-sample t-test for post-hoc analyses. Linear regression analyses were utilized to examine the regressions between the two methods and between different sessions with each method.

    "abstract": "The limbic brain is involved in diverse cognitive, emotional, and autonomic functions. Injury of the various parts of the limbic system have been correlated with clinical deficits in MS. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine different regions of the subcortical limbic system to assess the extent of damage within this entire system as it may be pertinent in correlating with specific aspects of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in MS by using a fully automated, unbiased segmentation approach.\nSixty-seven subjects were included in this study, including 52 with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 15 healthy controls. Only patients with stable MS disease, without any relapses, MRI activity, or disability progression were included. Subcortical limbic system segmentation was performed using the FreeSurfer pipeline ScLimbic, which provides volumes for fornix, mammillary bodies, hypothalamus, septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens, and basal forebrain. Hippocampus and anterior thalamic nuclei were added as additional components of the limbic circuitry, also segmented through FreeSurfer. Whole limbic region mask was generated by combining these structures and used for Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis.\nThe mean [95% confidence interval] of the total limbic system volume was lower (0.22% [0.21-0.23]) in MS compared to healthy controls (0.27%, [0.25-0.29], p < .001). Pairwise comparisons of individual limbic regions between MS and controls was significant in the nucleus accumbens (0.046%, [0.043-0.050] vs. 0.059%, [0.051-0.066], p = .005), hypothalamus (0.062%, [0.059-0.065] vs. 0.074%, [0.068-0.081], p = .001), basal forebrain (0.038%, [0.036-0.040] vs. 0.047%, [0.042-0.051], p = .001), hippocampus (0.47%, [0.45-0.49] vs. 0.53%, [0.49-0.57], p = .004), and anterior thalamus (0.077%, [0.072-0.082] vs. 0.093%, [0.084-0.10], p = .001) after Bonferroni correction. Volume of several limbic regions was significantly correlated with T2 lesion burden and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). Multiple regression model showed minimal influence of BPF on limbic brain volume and no influence of other demographic and disease state variables. VBM analysis showed cluster differences in the fornix and anterior thalamic nuclei at threshold p < 0.05 after adjusting for covariates but the results were insignificant after family-wise error corrections.\nThe results show evidence that brain volume loss is fairly extensive in the limbic brain. Given the significance of the limbic system in many disease states including MS, such volumetric analyses can be expanded to studying cognitive and emotional disturbances in larger clinical trials. FreeSurfer ScLimbic pipeline provided an efficient and reliable methodology for examining many of the subcortical structures related to the limbic brain.",

Volume of several limbic regions was significantly correlated with T2 lesion burden and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). Multiple regression model showed minimal influence of BPF on limbic brain volume and no influence of other demographic and disease state variables. VBM analysis showed cluster differences in the fornix and anterior thalamic nuclei at threshold p < 0.05 after adjusting for covariates but the results were insignificant after family-wise error corrections.",

    "abstract": "Large MRI studies often pool data gathered from widely varying imaging sequences. Pooled data creates a potential source of variation in structural analyses which may cause misinterpretation of findings. The purpose of this study is to determine if data acquired using different scan sequences, head coils and scanners offers consistent structural measurements.\nParticipants (163 right-handed males: 82 typically developing controls, 81 participants with autism spectrum disorder) were scanned on the same day using an MPRAGE sequence with a 12-channel headcoil on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner and an MP2RAGE sequence with a 64-channel headcoil on a Siemens 3T Prisma scanner. Segmentation was performed using FreeSurfer to identify regions exhibiting variation between sequences on measures of volume, surface area, and cortical thickness. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and mean percent difference (MPD) were used as test-retest reproducibility measures.\nICC for total brain segmented volume yielded a 0.99 intraclass correlation, demonstrating high overall volumetric reproducibility. Comparison of individual regions of interest resulted in greater variation. Volumetric variability, although low overall, was greatest in the entorhinal cortex (ICC = 0.71), frontal (ICC = 0.60) and temporal (ICC = 0.60) poles. Surface area variability was greatest in the insula (ICC = 0.65), temporal (ICC = 0.64) and frontal (ICC = 0.68) poles. Cortical thickness was most variable in the frontal (ICC = 0.41) and temporal (ICC = 0.35) poles.\nData collected on different scanners and head coils using MPRAGE and MP2RAGE are generally consistent for surface area and volume estimates. However, regional variability may constrain accuracy in some regions and cortical thickness measurements exhibit higher generalized variability.",

    "abstract": "Developing accurate subcortical volumetric quantification tools is crucial for neurodevelopmental studies, as they could reduce the need for challenging and time-consuming manual segmentation. In this study, the accuracy of two automated segmentation tools, FSL-FIRST (with three different boundary correction settings) and FreeSurfer, were compared against manual segmentation of the hippocampus and subcortical nuclei, including the amygdala, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate and nucleus accumbens, using volumetric and correlation analyses in 80 5-year-olds. Both FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer overestimated the volume on all structures except the caudate, and the accuracy varied depending on the structure. Small structures such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, which are visually difficult to distinguish, produced significant overestimations and weaker correlations with all automated methods. Larger and more readily distinguishable structures such as the caudate and putamen produced notably lower overestimations and stronger correlations. Overall, the segmentations performed by FSL-FIRST's default pipeline were the most accurate, whereas FreeSurfer's results were weaker across the structures. In line with prior studies, the accuracy of automated segmentation tools was imperfect with respect to manually defined structures. However, apart from amygdala and nucleus accumbens, FSL-FIRST's agreement could be considered satisfactory (Pearson correlation\u2009>\u20090.74, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\u2009>\u20090.68 and Dice score coefficient (DSC)\u2009>\u20090.87) with highest values for the striatal structures (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate) (Pearson correlation\u2009>\u20090.77, ICC\u2009>\u20090.87 and DSC\u2009>\u20090.88, respectively). Overall, automated segmentation tools do not always provide satisfactory results, and careful visual inspection of the automated segmentations is strongly advised.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric neuroimaging is a quickly developing field that still faces important methodological challenges. Pediatric images usually have more motion artifact than adult images. The artifact can cause visible errors in brain segmentation, and one way to address it is to manually edit the segmented images. Variability in editing and quality control protocols may complicate comparisons between studies. In this article, we describe in detail the semiautomated segmentation and quality control protocol of structural brain images that was used in FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study and relies on the well-established FreeSurfer v6.0 and ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) consortium tools. The participants were typically developing 5-year-olds [",

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to develop an approach to improve the speed and resolution of cerebral-hemisphere and lesion modeling and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of robot-assisted surgical planning software.\nWe applied both conventional robot planning software (method 1) and open-source auxiliary software (FreeSurfer and 3D Slicer; method 2) to model the brain and lesions in 19 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The patients' mean age at implantation was 21.4 years (range, 6-52 years). Each patient received an average of 12 electrodes (range, 9-16) between May and November 2021. The electrode-implantation plan was designed based on the models established using the two methods. We statistically analyzed and compared the duration of designing the models and planning the implantation using these two methods and performed the surgeries with the implantation plan designed using the auxiliary software.\nA significantly longer time was needed to reconstruct a cerebral-hemisphere model using method 1 (mean, 206 s) than using method 2 (mean, 20 s) (\nFreeSurfer and 3D Slicer-assisted SEEG implantation is an excellent approach to enhance modeling speed and resolution, shorten the electrode-implantation planning time, and boost the efficiency of clinical work. These well-known, trusted open-source programs do not have explicitly restricted licenses. These tools, therefore, seem well suited for clinical-research applications under the premise of approval by an ethics committee, informed consent of the patient, and clinical judgment of the surgeon.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) motion artefacts frequently complicate structural and diffusion MRI analyses. While diffusion imaging is easily 'scrubbed' of motion affected volumes, the same is not true for T1w or T2w 'structural' images. Structural images are critical to most diffusion-imaging pipelines thus their corruption can lead to disproportionate data loss. To enable diffusion-image processing when structural images are missing or have been corrupted, we propose a means by which synthetic structural images can be generated from diffusion MRI. This technique combines multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution, which is central to many existing diffusion analyses, with the Bloch equations that allow simulation of MRI intensities for given scanner parameters and magnetic resonance (MR) tissue properties. We applied this technique to 32 scans, including those acquired on different scanners, with different protocols and with pathology present. The resulting synthetic T1w and T2w images were visually convincing and exhibited similar tissue contrast to acquired structural images. These were also of sufficient quality to drive a Freesurfer-based tractographic analysis. In this analysis, probabilistic tractography connecting the thalamus to the primary sensorimotor cortex was delineated with Freesurfer, using either real or synthetic structural images. Tractography for real and synthetic conditions was largely identical in terms of both voxels encountered (Dice 0.88-0.95) and mean fractional anisotropy (intrasubject absolute difference 0.00-0.02). We provide executables for the proposed technique in the hope that these may aid the community in analysing datasets where structural image corruption is common, such as studies of children or cognitively impaired persons.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging pipelines have long been known to generate mildly differing results depending on various factors, including software version. While considered generally acceptable and within the margin of reasonable error, little is known about their effect in common research scenarios such as inter-group comparisons between healthy controls and various pathological conditions. The aim of the presented study was to explore the differences in the inferences and statistical significances in a model situation comparing volumetric parameters between healthy controls and type 1 diabetes patients using various FreeSurfer versions.\nT1- and T2-weighted structural scans of healthy controls and type 1 diabetes patients were processed with FreeSurfer 5.3, FreeSurfer 5.3 HCP, FreeSurfer 6.0 and FreeSurfer 7.1, followed by inter-group statistical comparison using outputs of individual FreeSurfer versions.\nWorryingly, FreeSurfer 5.3 detected both cortical and subcortical volume differences out of the preselected regions of interest, but newer versions such as FreeSurfer 5.3 HCP and FreeSurfer 6.0 reported only subcortical differences of lower magnitude and FreeSurfer 7.1 failed to find any statistically significant inter-group differences.\nSince group averages of individual FreeSurfer versions closely matched, in keeping with previous literature, the main origin of this disparity seemed to lie in substantially higher within-group variability in the model pathological condition. Ergo, until validation in common research scenarios as case-control comparison studies is included into the development process of new software suites, confirmatory analyses utilising a similar software based on analogous, but not fully equivalent principles, might be considered as supplement to careful quality control.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether reliable brain atrophy measures can be obtained from post-contrast 3D T1-weighted images in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using FreeSurfer.\nTwenty-two patients with MS were included, in which 3D T1-weighted MR images were obtained during the same scanner visit, with the same acquisition protocol, before and after administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). Two FreeSurfer versions (v.6.0.1 and v.7.1.1.) were applied to calculate grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes and global and regional cortical thickness. The consistency between measures obtained in pre- and post-contrast images was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), the difference was investigated by paired t-tests, and the mean percentage increase or decrease was calculated for total WM and GM matter volume, total deep GM and thalamus volume, and mean cortical thickness.\nGood to excellent reliability was found between all investigated measures, with ICC ranging from 0.926 to 0.996, all p values\u2009<\u20090.001. GM volumes and cortical thickness measurements were significantly higher in post-contrast images by 3.1 to 17.4%, while total WM volume decreased significantly by 1.7% (all p values\u2009<\u20090.001).\nThe consistency between values obtained from pre- and post-contrast images was excellent, suggesting it may be possible to extract reliable brain atrophy measurements from T1-weighted images acquired after administration of GBCAs, using FreeSurfer. However, absolute values were systematically different between pre- and post-contrast images, meaning that such images should not be compared directly. Potential systematic effects, possibly dependent on GBCA dose or the delay time after contrast injection, should be investigated.\nClinical trials.gov. identifier: NCT00360906.\n\u2022 The influence of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) on atrophy measurements is still largely unknown and challenges the use of a considerable source of historical and prospective real-world data. \u2022 In 22 patients with multiple sclerosis, the consistency between brain atrophy measurements obtained from pre- and post-contrast images was excellent, suggesting it may be possible to extract reliable atrophy measurements in T1-weighted images acquired after administration of GBCAs, using FreeSurfer. \u2022 Absolute values were systematically different between pre- and post-contrast images, meaning that such images should not be compared directly, and measurements extracted from certain regions (e.g., the temporal pole) should be interpreted with caution.",

    "conclusions": "The consistency between values obtained from pre- and post-contrast images was excellent, suggesting it may be possible to extract reliable brain atrophy measurements from T1-weighted images acquired after administration of GBCAs, using FreeSurfer. However, absolute values were systematically different between pre- and post-contrast images, meaning that such images should not be compared directly. Potential systematic effects, possibly dependent on GBCA dose or the delay time after contrast injection, should be investigated.",

Here, we compared and validated three algorithms for WMH extraction: FreeSurfer (T1w), UBO Detector (T1w\u2009+\u2009FLAIR), and FSL's Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (BIANCA; T1w\u2009+\u2009FLAIR) using a longitudinal dataset comprising MRI data of cognitively healthy older adults (baseline N\u00a0=\u00a0231, age range 64-87\u2009years). As reference we manually segmented WMH in T1w, three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR, and two-dimensional (2D) FLAIR images which were used to assess the segmentation accuracy of the different automated algorithms. Further, we assessed the relationships of WMH volumes provided by the algorithms with Fazekas scores and age. FreeSurfer underestimated the WMH volumes and scored worst in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC\u00a0=\u00a00.434) but its WMH volumes strongly correlated with the Fazekas scores (r",

    "abstract": "Large-scale longitudinal and multi-centre studies are used to explore neuroimaging markers of normal ageing, and neurodegenerative and mental health disorders. Longitudinal changes in brain structure are typically small, therefore the reliability of automated techniques is crucial. Determining the effects of different factors on reliability allows investigators to control those adversely affecting reliability, calculate statistical power, or even avoid particular brain measures with low reliability. This study examined the impact of several image acquisition and processing factors and documented the test-retest reliability of structural MRI measurements.\nIn Phase I, 20 healthy adults (11 females; aged 20-30 years) were scanned on two occasions three weeks apart on the same scanner using the ADNI-3 protocol. On each occasion, individuals were scanned twice (repetition), after re-entering the scanner (reposition) and after tilting their head forward. At one year follow-up, nine returning individuals and 11 new volunteers were recruited for Phase II (11 females; aged 22-31 years). Scans were acquired on two different scanners using the ADNI-2 and ADNI-3 protocols. Structural images were processed using FreeSurfer (v5.3.0, 6.0.0 and 7.1.0) to provide subcortical and cortical volume, cortical surface area and thickness measurements. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to estimate test-retest reliability. We examined the effect of repetition, reposition, head tilt, time between scans, MRI sequence and scanner on reliability of structural brain measurements. Mean percentage differences were also calculated in supplementary analyses.\nUsing the FreeSurfer v7.1.0 longitudinal pipeline, we observed high reliability for subcortical and cortical volumes, and cortical surface areas at repetition, reposition, three weeks and one year (mean ICCs>0.97). Cortical thickness reliability was lower (mean ICCs>0.82). Head tilt had the greatest adverse impact on ICC estimates, for example reducing mean right cortical thickness to ICC=0.74. In contrast, changes in ADNI sequence or MRI scanner had a minimal effect. We observed an increase in reliability for updated FreeSurfer versions, with the longitudinal pipeline consistently having a higher reliability than the cross-sectional pipeline.\nLongitudinal studies should monitor or control head tilt to maximise reliability. We provided the ICC estimates and mean percentage differences for all FreeSurfer brain regions, which may inform power analyses for clinical studies and have implications for the design of future longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "A test-retest study of FreeSurfer derived cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and cortical volume, as well as quantitative R1 relaxometry assessed on the midpoint of the cortex, was performed on a cohort of pediatric subjects (6-12 years old) scanned without sedation using SNARE-MPnRAGE (self navigated retrospective motion corrected magnetization prepared with n rapid gradient echoes) imaging. Reliability was assessed with coefficients of variation (CoVs) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and statistical tests were used to determine differences with and without SNARE motion correction. Comparison of the test-retest measures of SNARE-MPnRAGE with prospectively motion corrected PROMO MPRAGE were also performed. When SNARE motion correction was used all parameters had statistically significant improvements and demonstrated high reliability. Reliability varied depending on parameter, region, and measurement type (vertex or region of interest). For mean thickness/surface area/volume/mean R1 across the regions of FreeSurfer's DK Atlas, the mean CoVs (% x100) were (1.2/1.6/1.9/0.9) and the mean ICCs were (0.88/0.96/0.94/0.83). When assessed on a per-vertex basis, the CoVs and ICCs for thickness/R1 had mean values of (2.9/1.9) and (0.82/0.68) across the regions of the DK Atlas. Retrospectively motion corrected MPnRAGE had significantly lower CoVs and higher ICCs for the morphological measures than PROMO MPRAGE. Motion correction effectively removed motion related biases in nearly all regions for R1 and morphometric measures.",

    "abstract": "The cortical thickness has been used as a biomarker to assess different cerebral conditions and to detect alterations in the cortical mantle. In this work, we compare methods from the FreeSurfer software, the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12), a Laplacian approach and a new method here proposed, based on the Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT), and its corresponding computational phantom designed to validate the calculation algorithm. At region of interest (ROI) level, within- and inter-method comparisons were carried out with a test-retest analysis, in a subset comprising 21 healthy subjects taken from the Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource (MMRR) dataset. From the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) data, classification methods were compared in their performance to detect cortical thickness differences between 23 healthy controls (HC) and 45 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The validation of the proposed EDT-based method showed a more accurate and precise distance measurement as voxel resolution increased. For the within-method comparisons, mean test-retest measures (percentages differences/intraclass correlation/Pearson correlation) were similar for FreeSurfer (1.80%/0.90/0.95), CAT12 (1.91%/0.83/0.91), Laplacian (1.27%/0.89/0.95) and EDT (2.20%/0.88/0.94). Inter-method correlations showed moderate to strong values (R\u2009>\u20090.77) and, in the AD comparison study, all methods were able to detect cortical alterations between groups. Surface- and voxel-based methods have advantages and drawbacks regarding computational demands and measurement precision, while thickness definition was mainly associated to the cortical thickness absolute differences among methods. However, for each method, measurements were reliable, followed similar trends along the cortex and allowed detection of cortical atrophies between HC and patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to early life trauma is common and confers risk for psychological disorders in adolescence, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma exposure and PTSD are also consistently linked to alterations in gray matter volume (GMV). Despite the quantity of structural neuroimaging research in trauma-exposed populations, little consensus exists amongst research groups on best practices for image processing method and manual editing procedures. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the utility of manual editing of magnetic resonance (MR) images for detecting PTSD-related group differences in GMV. Here, T1-weighted MR images from adolescent girls aged 11-17 were obtained and analyzed. Two datasets were created from the FreeSurfer reconall pipeline, one of which was manually edited by trained research assistants. Gray matter regions of interest were selected and total volume estimates were entered into linear mixed effects models with method (manual edits or automated) as a within-subjects factor and group dummy-coded with PTSD as the reference group. Consistent with prior literature, individuals with PTSD demonstrated reduced GMV of the amygdala compared to trauma-exposed and non-trauma exposed controls, independent of editing method. Our results demonstrate that amygdala GMV reductions in PTSD are robust to certain methodological choices and do not suggest a benefit to the time-intensive manual editing pipeline in FreeSurfer for quantifying PTSD-related GMV.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable whole-brain segmentation is critical to longitudinal neuroimaging studies. We undertake a comparative analysis of two subcortical segmentation methods, Automatic Segmentation (ASEG) and Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG), recently provided in the open-source neuroimaging package FreeSurfer 7.1, with regard to reliability, bias, sensitivity to detect longitudinal change, and diagnostic sensitivity to Alzheimer's disease. First, we assess intra- and inter-scanner reliability for eight bilateral subcortical structures: amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, lateral ventricles, nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen and thalamus. For intra-scanner analysis we use a large sample of participants (n\u00a0=\u00a01629) distributed across the lifespan (age range\u00a0=\u00a04-93 years) and acquired on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto (n\u00a0=\u00a0774) and a 3T Siemens Skyra (n\u00a0=\u00a0855) scanners. For inter-scanner analysis we use a sample of 24 participants scanned on the day with three models of Siemens scanners: 1.5T Avanto, 3T Skyra and 3T Prisma. Second, we test how each method detects volumetric age change using longitudinal follow up scans (n\u00a0=\u00a0491 for Avanto and n\u00a0=\u00a0245 for Skyra; interscan interval\u00a0=\u00a01-10 years). Finally, we test sensitivity to clinically relevant change. We compare annual rate of hippocampal atrophy in cognitively normal older adults (n\u00a0=\u00a020), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and Alzheimer's disease (n\u00a0=\u00a020). We find that both ASEG and SAMSEG are reliable and lead to the detection of within-person longitudinal change, although with notable differences between age-trajectories for most structures, including hippocampus and amygdala. In summary, SAMSEG yields significantly lower differences between repeated measures for intra- and inter-scanner analysis without compromising sensitivity to changes and demonstrating ability to detect clinically relevant longitudinal changes.",

    "abstract": "Depression is the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and hippocampal sclerosis (HS). This study aimed to confirm whether patients with comorbid depression have different volumetric patterns on magnetic resonance imaging, analysing the influence of HS sides. Psychiatrists conducted semi-structured interviews with 75 patients, who were divided into non-depression group (NDG, n\u00a0=\u00a052) and depression group (DG, n\u00a0=\u00a023), and compared with 98 controls. The FreeSurfer software was used in the volumetric analysis of the estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), bilateral cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs), and for presence of left (L-, n\u00a0=\u00a041) or right (R-, n\u00a0=\u00a034) MTLE-HS. Twenty-three (30.7%) patients had depression, of whom 14 (34.1%) had l-MTLE-HS and 9 (26.5%) had R-MTLE-HS. No difference was observed between DG and NDG vs. controls in terms of eTIV and cortical ROIs, regardless of the severity of depression. In patients with l-MTLE-HS, the eTIV in the DG was reduced in comparison with that in the NDG and control group, with a small effect size. Hippocampal reduction occurred ipsilateral to HS in the l-MTLE-HS and R-MTLE-HS subgroups when DG and NDG were compared with controls, as expected according to Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (2018).",

In 43 of the 85 patients with MCI, three-dimensional, T1-weighted MRI data were obtained at an in-plane resolution of 1.2 mm. The data of the remaining 42 patients with MCI and the healthy volunteers were obtained at an in-plane resolution of 1.0 mm.

In the subgroup of healthy volunteers, the intermethod reliability was only good in some regions (frontal, temporal, cingulate, and insular). The intermethod reproducibility was better in the 1.0-mm group than the 1.2-mm group in all regions other than the nucleus accumbens.\nInbrain and FreeSurfer showed good-to-excellent intermethod reproducibility for volumetric measurements.

    "abstract": "Volumetric estimates of subcortical and cortical structures, extracted from T1-weighted MRIs, are widely used in many clinical and research applications. Here, we investigate the impact of the presence of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on FreeSurfer gray matter (GM) structure volumes and its possible bias on functional relationships. T1-weighted images from 1,077 participants (4,321 timepoints) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were processed with FreeSurfer version 6.0.0. WMHs were segmented using a previously validated algorithm on either T2-weighted or Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the relationships between overlapping WMHs and GM structure volumes and overall WMH burden, as well as to investigate whether such overlaps impact associations with age, diagnosis, and cognitive performance. Participants with higher WMH volumes had higher overlaps with GM volumes of bilateral caudate, cerebral cortex, putamen, thalamus, pallidum, and accumbens areas (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). When not corrected for WMHs, caudate volumes increased with age (p\u2009<\u2009.0001) and were not different between cognitively healthy individuals and age-matched probable Alzheimer's disease patients. After correcting for WMHs, caudate volumes decreased with age (p\u2009<\u2009.0001), and Alzheimer's disease patients had lower caudate volumes than cognitively healthy individuals (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Uncorrected caudate volume was not associated with ADAS13 scores, whereas corrected lower caudate volumes were significantly associated with poorer cognitive performance (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). Presence of WMHs leads to systematic inaccuracies in GM segmentations, particularly for the caudate, which can also change clinical associations. While specifically measured for the Freesurfer toolkit, this problem likely affects other algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the inter-method reliability and volumetric differences between NeuroQuant (NQ) and Freesurfer (FS) using T1 volume imaging sequence with different slice thicknesses in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nThis retrospective study enrolled 80 patients diagnosed with MCI at our memory clinic. NQ and FS were used for volumetric analysis of three-dimensional T1-weighted images with slice thickness of 1 and 1.2 mm. Inter-method reliability was measured with Pearson correlation coefficient (r), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and effect size (ES).\nOverall, NQ volumes were larger than FS volumes in several locations: whole brain (0.78%), cortical gray matter (5.34%), and white matter (2.68%). Volume measures by NQ and FS showed good-to-excellent ICCs with both 1 and 1.2 mm slice thickness (ICC=0.75-0.97, ES=-1.0-0.73 vs. ICC=0.78-0.96, ES=-0.9-0.77, respectively), except for putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and total intracranial volumes. The ICCs in all locations, except the putamen and cerebellum, were slightly higher with a slice thickness of 1 mm compared to those of 1.2 mm.\nInter-method reliability between NQ and FS was good-to-excellent in most regions with improvement with a 1-mm slice thickness. This finding indicates that the potential effects of slice thickness should be considered when performing volumetric measurements for cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Structural hippocampal abnormalities are common in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, and variation in hippocampal measures is related to cognitive performance and other complex phenotypes such as stress sensitivity. Hippocampal subregions are increasingly studied, as automated algorithms have become available for mapping and volume quantification. In the context of the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis Consortium, several Disease Working Groups are using the FreeSurfer software to analyze hippocampal subregion (subfield) volumes in patients with neurological and psychiatric conditions along with data from matched controls. In this overview, we explain the algorithm's principles, summarize measurement reliability studies, and demonstrate two additional aspects (subfield autocorrelation and volume/reliability correlation) with illustrative data. We then explain the rationale for a standardized hippocampal subfield segmentation quality control (QC) procedure for improved pipeline harmonization. To guide researchers to make optimal use of the algorithm, we discuss how global size and age effects can be modeled, how QC steps can be incorporated and how subfields may be aggregated into composite volumes. This discussion is based on a synopsis of 162 published neuroimaging studies (01/2013-12/2019) that applied the FreeSurfer hippocampal subfield segmentation in a broad range of domains including cognition and healthy aging, brain development and neurodegeneration, affective disorders, psychosis, stress regulation, neurotoxicity, epilepsy, inflammatory disease, childhood adversity and posttraumatic stress disorder, and candidate and whole genome (epi-)genetics. Finally, we highlight points where FreeSurfer-based hippocampal subfield studies may be optimized.",

    "abstract": "There are instances in which an estimate of the brain volume should be obtained from MRI in clinical practice. Our objective is to calculate cross-sectional robustness of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based software (Entelai Pic) for brain volume estimation and compare it to traditional software such as FreeSurfer, CAT12 and FSL in healthy controls (HC).\nSixteen HC were scanned four times, two different days on two different MRI scanners (1.5\u202fT and 3\u202fT). Volumetric T1-weighted images were acquired and post-processed with FreeSurfer v6.0.0, Entelai Pic v2, CAT12 v12.5 and FSL v5.0.9. Whole-brain, grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes were calculated. Correlation and agreement between methods was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland Altman plots. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).\nWhole-brain volume estimation had better correlation between FreeSurfer and Entelai Pic (ICC (95% CI) 0.96 (0.94-0.97)) than FreeSurfer and CAT12 (0.92 (0.88-0.96)) and FSL (0.87 (0.79-0.91)). WM, GM and CSF showed a similar trend. Compared to FreeSurfer, Entelai Pic provided similarly robust segmentations of brain volumes both on same-scanner (mean CV 1.07, range 0.20-3.13% vs. mean CV 1.05, range 0.21-3.20%, p\u202f=\u202f0.86) and on different-scanner variables (mean CV 3.84, range 2.49-5.91% vs. mean CV 3.84, range 2.62-5.13%, p\u202f=\u202f0.96). Mean post-processing times were 480, 5, 40 and 5\u202fmin for FreeSurfer, Entelai Pic, CAT12 and FSL respectively.\nBased on robustness and processing times, our CNN-based model is suitable for cross-sectional volumetry on clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of brain anatomy has been a key processing step in quantitative neuroimaging analyses. An extensive body of literature has relied on Freesurfer segmentations. Yet, in recent years, the multi-atlas segmentation framework has consistently obtained results with superior accuracy in various evaluations. We compared brain anatomy segmentations from Freesurfer, which uses a single probabilistic atlas strategy, against segmentations from Multi-atlas region Segmentation utilizing Ensembles of registration algorithms and parameters and locally optimal atlas selection (MUSE), one of the leading ensemble-based methods that calculates a consensus segmentation through fusion of anatomical labels from multiple atlases and registrations. The focus of our evaluation was twofold. First, using manual ground-truth hippocampus segmentations, we found that Freesurfer segmentations showed a bias towards over-segmentation of larger hippocampi, and under-segmentation in older age. This bias was more pronounced in Freesurfer-v5.3, which has been used in multiple previous studies of aging, while the effect was mitigated in more recent Freesurfer-v6.0, albeit still present. Second, we evaluated inter-scanner segmentation stability using same day scan pairs from ADNI acquired on 1.5T and 3T scanners. We also found that MUSE obtains more consistent segmentations across scanners compared to Freesurfer, particularly in the deep structures.",

It remains uncertain to what extent smaller brain volumes and potential changes in grey/white matter contrasts in paediatric brains impact on the performance of automated methods, and how pathology may influence performance. This study examined whether using data from automated FreeSurfer segmentation would alter our ability, compared to manual segmentation, to detect prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related volume changes in subcortical regions and the corpus callosum (CC) in pre-adolescent children. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired, using a sequence optimized for morphometric neuroanatomical analysis, on a Siemens 3T Allegra MRI scanner in 71 right-handed, 9- to 11-year-old children (27 fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS), 25 non-syndromal heavily exposed (HE) and 19 non-exposed controls) from a high-risk community in Cape Town, South Africa. Data from timeline follow-back interviews administered to the mothers prospectively during pregnancy were used to quantify the amount of alcohol (in ounces absolute alcohol per day, AA/day) that the children had been exposed to prenatally. Volumes of corpus callosum (CC) and bilateral caudate nuclei, hippocampi and nucleus accumbens (NA) were obtained by manual tracing and automated segmentation using both FreeSurfer versions 5.1 and 6.0. Reliability across methods was assessed using intraclass correlation (ICC) estimates for consistency and absolute agreement, and Cronbach's \u03b1. Ability to detect regions showing PAE effects was assessed separately for each segmentation method using ANOVA and linear regression of regional volumes with AA/day. Our results support findings from other studies showing excellent reliability across methods for easy-to-segment structures, such as the CC and caudate nucleus. Volumes from FreeSurfer 6.0 were smaller than those from version 5.1 in all regions except the right caudate, for which they were similar, and right hippocampus and CC, for which they were larger. Despite poor absolute agreement between methods in the NA and hippocampus, all three segmentation methods detected dose-dependent volume reductions in regions for which reliabilities on ICC consistency across methods reached at least 0.70, namely the CC, and bilateral caudate nuclei and hippocampi. PAE-related changes in the NA for which ICC consistency did not reach this minimum were inconsistent across methods and should be interpreted with caution. This is the first study to demonstrate in a pre-adolescent cohort the ability of automated segmentation with FreeSurfer to detect regional volume changes associated with pathology similar to those found using manual tracing.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia can be considered a brain disconnectivity condition related to aberrant neurodevelopment that causes alterations in the brain structure, including gyrification of the cortex. Literature findings on cortical folding are incoherent: they report hypogyria in the frontal, superior-parietal and temporal cortices, but also frontal hypergyria. This discrepancy in local gyrification index (LGI) results could be due to the commonly used spherical kernel (Freesurfer), which is a method of analysis that is still not spatially precise enough. In this study we would like to test the spatial accuracy of a novel method based on a shape-adaptive kernel (Cmorph). The analysis of differences in gyrification between chronic schizophrenia outpatients (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30) was conducted with two methods: Freesurfer LGI and Cmorph LGI. Widespread differences in the LGI between schizophrenia outpatients and healthy controls were found using both methods. Freesurfer showed hypogyria in the superior temporal gyrus and the right temporal pole; it also showed hypergyria in the rostral-middle-frontal cortex in schizophrenia outpatients. In comparison, Cmorph revealed that hypergyria is equally represented as hypogyria in orbitofrontal and central brain regions. The clusters from Cmorph were smaller and distributed more broadly, covering all lobes of the brain. The presented evidence from disrupted cortical folding in schizophrenia indicates that the shape-adaptive kernel approach has a potential to improve the knowledge on the disrupted cortical folding in schizophrenia; therefore, it could be a valuable tool for further investigation on big sample size.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau proteins. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful means of detecting hippocampal atrophy. However, instead of visual inspection, objective and time-saving tools for automated region of interest (ROI) analysis are needed. Advances in MRI segmentation techniques have enabled a multi-atlas approach with fewer errors than a conventional single-atlas approach. To support the clinical application of multi-atlas segmentation, an automated ROI analytic application consisting of multi-atlas segmentation with joint label fusion and corrective learning was developed: T-Proto. In the present study, we evaluated the inter-method reliability between T-Proto and a reference ROI analytic software, FreeSurfer.\nThis was a database study. MRI data from 30 patients with AD were selected, and the inter-method reliability was assessed in terms of the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). A post-hoc comparison according to the severity of AD was also performed.\nAlmost all the regional volumes estimated with T-Proto were smaller than those estimated with FreeSurfer. The regional ICC values between the two methods showed moderate to excellent reliability. A post-hoc comparison revealed a similar t-value and effect size between both methods for the hippocampus.\nIn the present study, we showed that automated regional analysis using T-Proto was reliable in the hippocampus in terms of ICC, compared with FreeSurfer.",

    "abstract": "The development of automated tools for brain morphometric analysis in infants has lagged significantly behind analogous tools for adults. This gap reflects the greater challenges in this domain due to: 1) a smaller-scaled region of interest, 2) increased motion corruption, 3) regional changes in geometry due to heterochronous growth, and 4) regional variations in contrast properties corresponding to ongoing myelination and other maturation processes. Nevertheless, there is a great need for automated image-processing tools to quantify differences between infant groups and other individuals, because aberrant cortical morphologic measurements (including volume, thickness, surface area, and curvature) have been associated with neuropsychiatric, neurologic, and developmental disorders in children. In this paper we present an automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline designed to accommodate clinical MRI studies of infant brains in a population 0-2 year-olds. The algorithm relies on a single channel of T1-weighted MR images to achieve automated segmentation of cortical and subcortical brain areas, producing volumes of subcortical structures and surface models of the cerebral cortex. We evaluated the algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively using manually labeled datasets, relevant comparator software solutions cited in the literature, and expert evaluations. The computational tools and atlases described in this paper will be distributed to the research community as part of the FreeSurfer image analysis package.",

    "abstract": "Insights into brain anatomy are important for the early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as dyslexia. FreeSurfer is one of the most frequently applied automatized software tools to study brain morphology. However, quality control of the outcomes provided by FreeSurfer is often ignored and could lead to wrong statistical inferences. Additional manual editing of the data may be a solution, although not without a cost in time and resources. Past research in adults on comparing the automatized method of FreeSurfer with and without additional manual editing indicated that although editing may lead to significant differences in morphological measures between the methods in some regions, it does not substantially change the sensitivity to detect clinical differences. Given that automated approaches are more likely to fail in pediatric-and inherently more noisy-data, we investigated in the current study whether FreeSurfer can be applied fully automatically or additional manual edits of T1-images are needed in a pediatric sample. Specifically, cortical thickness and surface area measures with and without additional manual edits were compared in six regions of interest (ROIs) of the reading network in 5-to-6-year-old children with and without dyslexia. Results revealed that additional editing leads to statistical differences in the morphological measures, but that these differences are consistent across subjects and that the sensitivity to reveal statistical differences in the morphological measures between children with and without dyslexia is not affected, even though conclusions of marginally significant findings can differ depending on the method used. Thereby, our results indicate that additional manual editing of reading-related regions in FreeSurfer has limited gain for pediatric samples.",

    "abstract": "Several automatic image segmentation methods and few atlas databases exist for analysing structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance brain images. The impact of choosing a combination has not hitherto been described but may bias comparisons across studies. We evaluated two segmentation methods (MAPER and FreeSurfer), using three publicly available atlas databases (Hammers_mith, Desikan-Killiany-Tourville, and MICCAI 2012 Grand Challenge). For each combination of atlas and method, we conducted a leave-one-out cross-comparison to estimate the segmentation accuracy of FreeSurfer and MAPER. We also used each possible combination to segment two datasets of patients with known structural abnormalities (Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (HS)) and their matched healthy controls. MAPER was better than FreeSurfer at modelling manual segmentations in the healthy control leave-one-out analyses in two of the three atlas databases, and the Hammers_mith atlas database transferred to new datasets best regardless of segmentation method. Both segmentation methods reliably identified known abnormalities in each patient group. Better separation was seen for FreeSurfer in the AD and left-HS datasets, and for MAPER in the right-HS dataset. We provide detailed quantitative comparisons for multiple anatomical regions, thus enabling researchers to make evidence-based decisions on their choice of atlas and segmentation method.",

    "abstract": "The human hippocampus is vulnerable to a range of degenerative conditions and as such, accurate in vivo measurement of the hippocampus and hippocampal substructures via neuroimaging is of great interest for understanding mechanisms of disease as well as for use as a biomarker in clinical trials of novel therapeutics. Although total hippocampal volume can be measured relatively reliably, it is critical to understand how this reliability is affected by acquisition on different scanners, as multiple scanning platforms would likely be utilized in large-scale clinical trials. This is particularly true for hippocampal subregional measurements, which have only relatively recently been measurable through common image processing platforms such as FreeSurfer. Accurate segmentation of these subregions is challenging due to their small size, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal loss in medial temporal regions of the brain, and lack of contrast for delineation from standard neuroimaging procedures. Here, we assess the test-retest reliability of the FreeSurfer automated hippocampal subfield segmentation procedure using two Siemens model scanners (a Siemens Trio and Prisma",

    "abstract": "The lack of inter-method agreement can produce inconsistent results in neuroimaging studies. We evaluated the intra-method repeatability and the inter-method reproducibility of two widely-used automatic segmentation methods for brain MRI: the FreeSurfer (FS) and the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software packages.\nWe segmented the gray matter (GM), the white matter (WM) and subcortical structures in test-retest MRI data of healthy volunteers from Kirby-21 and OASIS datasets. We used Pearson's correlation (r), Bland-Altman plot and Dice index to study intra-method repeatability and inter-method reproducibility. In order to test whether different processing methods affect the results of a neuroimaging-based group study, we carried out a statistical comparison between male and female volume measures.\nA high correlation was found between test-retest volume measures for both SPM (r in the 0.98-0.99 range) and FS (r in the 0.95-0.99 range). A non-null bias between test-retest FS volumes was detected for GM and WM in the OASIS dataset. The inter-method reproducibility analysis measured volume correlation values in the 0.72-0.98 range and the overlap between the segmented structures assessed by the Dice index was in the 0.76-0.83 range. SPM systematically provided significantly greater GM volumes and lower WM and subcortical volumes with respect to FS. In the male vs. female brain volume comparisons, inconsistencies arose for the OASIS dataset, where the gender-related differences appear subtler with respect to the Kirby dataset.\nThe inter-method reproducibility should be evaluated before interpreting the results of neuroimaging studies.",

    "abstract": "Ratios between opposing volumes from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide additional information to volumes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain three-dimensional MPRAGE MRI at 3T were segmented into 44 regions using FreeSurfer v6 in 75 participants. The region's size in absolute volumes and relative proportions to the whole brain volume were compared between 39 AD patients and 36 age-, education- and sex-matched normal controls (NC). Volumes of the most atrophied parts were related to the opposing volumes of the most enlarged parts as ratios. The most atrophic structures in AD were both hippocampi. By contrast, the greatest enlargements in AD were inferior parts of both lateral ventricles. The best ratio for each side was the hippocampo-horn proportion calculated as ratio: the hippocampus / (the hippocampus\u202f+\u202finferior lateral ventricle). Its optimal cut-off of 74% yielded sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 78% on the left and sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 78% on the right. The hippocampo-horn proportion is another measure to evaluate the degree of hippocampal atrophy on brain MRI in percentages. It has a potential to be simplified into a comparison of two-dimensional corresponding areas or a visual assessment.",

    "abstract": "Performing quality control to detect image artifacts and data-processing errors is crucial in structural magnetic resonance imaging, especially in developmental studies. Currently, many studies rely on visual inspection by trained raters for quality control. The subjectivity of these manual procedures lessens comparability between studies, and with growing study sizes quality control is increasingly time consuming. In addition, both inter-rater as well as intra-rater variability of manual quality control is high and may lead to inclusion of poor quality scans and exclusion of scans of usable quality. In the current study we present the Qoala-T tool, which is an easy and free to use supervised-learning model to reduce rater bias and misclassification in manual quality control procedures using FreeSurfer-processed scans. First, we manually rated quality of N\u202f=\u202f784 FreeSurfer-processed T1-weighted scans acquired in three different waves in a longitudinal study. Different supervised-learning models were then compared to predict manual quality ratings using FreeSurfer segmented output data. Results show that the Qoala-T tool using random forests is able to predict scan quality with both high sensitivity and specificity (mean area under the curve (AUC)\u202f=\u202f0.98). In addition, the Qoala-T tool was also able to adequately predict the quality of two novel unseen datasets (total N\u202f=\u202f872). Finally, analyses of age effects showed that younger participants were more likely to have lower scan quality, underlining that scan quality might confound findings attributed to age effects. These outcomes indicate that this procedure could further help to reduce variability related to manual quality control, thereby benefiting the comparability of data quality between studies.",

    "abstract": "Automated neuroimaging methods like FreeSurfer ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ ) have revolutionized quantitative neuroimaging analyses. Such analyses provide a variety of metrics used for image quantification, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetrics. With the release of FreeSurfer version 6.0, it is important to assess its comparability to the widely-used previous version 5.3. The current study used data from the initial 249 participants in the ongoing Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) multicenter observational study to compare the volumetric output of versions 5.3 and 6.0 across various regions of interest (ROI). In the current investigation, the following ROIs were examined: total intracranial volume, total white matter volume, total ventricular volume, total gray matter volume, and right and left volumes for the thalamus, pallidum, putamen, caudate, amygdala and hippocampus. Absolute ROI volumes derived from FreeSurfer 6.0 differed significantly from those obtained using version 5.3. We also employed a clinically-based evaluation strategy to compare both versions in their prediction of age-mediated volume reductions (or ventricular increase) in the aforementioned structures. Statistical comparison involved both general linear modeling (GLM) and random forest (RF) methods, where cross-validation error was significantly higher using segmentations from FreeSurfer version 5.3 versus version 6.0 (GLM: t\u2009=\u20094.97, df\u2009=\u200999, p value\u2009=\u20092.706e-06; RF: t\u2009=\u20094.85, df\u2009=\u200999, p value\u2009=\u20094.424e-06). Additionally, the relative importance of ROIs used to predict age using RFs differed between FreeSurfer versions, indicating substantial differences in the two versions. However, from the perspective of correlational analyses, fitted regression lines and their slopes were similar between the two versions, regardless of version used. While absolute volumes are not interchangeable between version 5.3 and 6.0, ROI correlational analyses appear to yield similar results, suggesting the interchangeability of ROI volume for correlational studies.",

    "abstract": "To compare the cross-sectional robustness of commonly used volumetric software and effects of lesion filling in multiple sclerosis (MS).\nNine MS patients (six females; age 38\u00b113 years, disease duration 7.3\u00b15.2 years) were scanned twice with repositioning on three MRI scanners (Siemens Aera 1.5T, Avanto 1.5T, Trio 3.0T) the same day. Volumetric T\nVariability in volumetrics was lower within than between scanners (CoV 0.17-0.96% vs. 0.65-5.0%, p<0.001). All software provided similarly robust segmentations of the brain volume on the same scanner (CoV 0.17-0.28%, p=0.076). Normalisation improved inter-scanner reproducibility in FreeSurfer and SPM-based methods, but the FSL-SIENAX scaling factor did not improve robustness. Generally, SPM-based methods produced the most consistent volumetrics, while FreeSurfer was more robust for WM volumes on different scanners. FreeSurfer had more robust normalised brain and GM volumes on different scanners than FSL-SIENAX (p=0.004). MS lesion filling changed the output of FSL-SIENAX, SPM and SPM-CAT but not FreeSurfer.\nConsistent use of the same scanner is essential and normalisation to the intracranial volume is recommended for multiple scanners. Based on robustness, SPM-based methods are particularly suitable for cross-sectional volumetry. FreeSurfer poses a suitable alternative with WM segmentations less sensitive to MS lesions.\n\u2022 The same scanner should be used for brain volumetry. If different scanners are used, the intracranial volume normalisation improves the FreeSurfer and SPM robustness (but not the FSL scaling factor). \u2022 FreeSurfer, FSL and SPM all provide robust measures of the whole brain volume on the same MRI scanner. SPM-based methods overall provide the most robust segmentations (except white matter segmentations on different scanners where FreeSurfer is more robust). \u2022 MS lesion filling with Lesion Segmentation Toolbox changes the output of FSL-SIENAX and SPM. FreeSurfer output is not affected by MS lesion filling since it already takes white matter hypointensities into account and is therefore particularly suitable for MS brain volumetry.",

    "abstract": "Quality assurance (QA) is vital for ensuring the integrity of processed neuroimaging data for use in clinical neurosciences research. Manual QA (visual inspection) of processed brains for cortical surface reconstruction errors is resource-intensive, particularly with large datasets. Several semi-automated QA tools use quantitative detection of subjects for editing based on outlier brain regions. There were two project goals: (1) evaluate the assumption that statistical outliers are related to errors of cortical extension, and (2) examine whether error identification and correction significantly impacts estimation of cortical parameters and established brain-behavior relationships. T1 MPRAGE images (N\u2009=\u2009530) of healthy adults were obtained from the NKI-Rockland Sample and reconstructed using Freesurfer 5.3. Visual inspection of T1 images was conducted for: (1) participants (n\u2009=\u2009110) with outlier values (z scores \u00b13 SD) for subcortical and cortical segmentation volumes (outlier group), and (2) a random sample of remaining participants (n\u2009=\u2009110) with segmentation values that did not meet the outlier criterion (non-outlier group). The outlier group had 21% more participants with visual inspection-identified errors than participants in the non-outlier group, with a medium effect size (\u03a6\u2009=\u20090.22). Nevertheless, a considerable portion of images with errors of cortical extension were found in the non-outlier group (41%). Although nine brain regions significantly changed size from pre- to post-editing (with effect sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.59), editing did not substantially change the correlations of neurocognitive tasks and brain volumes (ps\u2009>\u20090.05). Statistically-based QA, although less resource intensive, is not accurate enough to supplant visual inspection. We discuss practical implications of our findings to guide resource allocation decisions for image processing.",

    "abstract": "It is important to have accurate estimates of normal age-related brain structure changes and to understand how the choice of measurement technique may bias those estimates. We compared longitudinal change in hippocampal volume, laterality and atrophy measured by manual tracing and FreeSurfer (version 5.3) in middle age (n\u2009=\u2009244, 47.2[1.4] years) and older age (n\u2009=\u2009199, 67.0[1.4] years) individuals over 8\u00a0years. The proportion of overlap (Dice coefficient) between the segmented hippocampi was calculated and we hypothesised that the proportion of overlap would be higher for older individuals as a consequence of higher atrophy. Hippocampal volumes produced by FreeSurfer were larger than manually traced volumes. Both methods produced a left less than right volume laterality difference. Over time this laterality difference increased for manual tracing and decreased for FreeSurfer leading to laterality differences in left and right estimated atrophy rates. The overlap proportion between methods was not significantly different for older individuals, but was greater for the right hippocampus. Estimated middle age annualised atrophy rates were -\u20090.39(1.0) left, 0.07(1.01) right, -\u20090.17(0.88) total for manual tracing and -\u20090.15(0.69) left, -\u20090.20(0.63) right, -\u20090.18(0.57) total for FreeSurfer. Older age atrophy rates were -\u20090.43(1.32) left, -\u20090.15(1.41) right, -\u20090.30 (1.23) total for manual tracing and -\u20090.34(0.79) left, -\u20090.68(0.78) right, -\u20090.51(0.65) total for FreeSurfer. FreeSurfer reliably segments the hippocampus producing atrophy rates that are comparable to manual tracing with some biases that need to be considered in study design. FreeSurfer is suited for use in large longitudinal studies where it is not cost effective to use manual tracing.",

    "abstract": "The results of most neuroimaging studies are reported in volumetric (e.g., MNI152) or surface (e.g., fsaverage) coordinate systems. Accurate mappings between volumetric and surface coordinate systems can facilitate many applications, such as projecting fMRI group analyses from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage for visualization or projecting resting-state fMRI parcellations from fsaverage to MNI152/Colin27 for volumetric analysis of new data. However, there has been surprisingly little research on this topic. Here, we evaluated three approaches for mapping data between MNI152/Colin27 and fsaverage coordinate systems by simulating the above applications: projection of group-average data from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage and projection of fsaverage parcellations to MNI152/Colin27. Two of the approaches are currently widely used. A third approach (registration fusion) was previously proposed, but not widely adopted. Two implementations of the registration fusion (RF) approach were considered, with one implementation utilizing the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). We found that RF-ANTs performed the best for mapping between fsaverage and MNI152/Colin27, even for new subjects registered to MNI152/Colin27 using a different software tool (FSL FNIRT). This suggests that RF-ANTs would be useful even for researchers not using ANTs. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the most optimal approach for mapping data to a coordinate system (e.g., fsaverage) is to register individual subjects directly to the coordinate system, rather than via another coordinate system. Only in scenarios where the optimal approach is not possible (e.g., mapping previously published results from MNI152 to fsaverage), should the approaches evaluated in this manuscript be considered. In these scenarios, we recommend RF-ANTs (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion).",

    "abstract": "MRI has become an indispensable tool for brain volumetric studies, with the hippocampus an important region of interest. Automation of the MRI segmentation process has helped advance the field by facilitating the volumetric analysis of larger cohorts and more studies. FreeSurfer has emerged as the de facto standard tool for these analyses, but studies validating its output are all based on older versions. To characterize FreeSurfer's validity, we compare several versions of FreeSurfer software with traditional hand-tracing. Using MRI images of 262 males and 402 females aged 38 to 84, we directly compare estimates of hippocampal volume from multiple versions of FreeSurfer, its hippocampal subfield routines, and our manual tracing protocol. We then use those estimates to assess asymmetry and atrophy, comparing performance of different estimators with each other and with brain atrophy measures. FreeSurfer consistently reports larger volumes than manual tracing. This difference is smaller in larger hippocampi or older people, with these biases weaker in version 6.0.0 than prior versions. All methods tested agree qualitatively on rightward asymmetry and increasing atrophy in older people. FreeSurfer saves time and money, and approximates the same atrophy measures as manual tracing, but it introduces biases that could require statistical adjustments in some studies.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation of human brain structures is crucial for the volumetric quantification of brain disease. Advances in algorithmic approaches have led to automated techniques that save time compared to interactive methods. Recently, the utility and accuracy of template library fusion algorithms, such as Local MAP PSTAPLE (PSTAPLE), have been demonstrated but there is little guidance regarding its reproducibility compared to single template-based algorithms such as FreeSurfer and FSL-FIRST.\nEight repeated magnetic resonance imagings of 20 subjects were segmented using FreeSurfer, FSL-FIRST, and PSTAPLE. We reported the reproducibility of segmentation-derived volume measurements for brain structures and calculated sample size estimates for detecting hypothetical rates of tissue atrophy given the observed variances.\nPSTAPLE had the most reproducible volume measurements for hippocampus, putamen, thalamus, caudate, pallidum, amygdala, Accumbens area, and cortical regions. FreeSurfer was most reproducible for brainstem. PSTAPLE was the most accurate algorithm in terms of several metrics include Dice's coefficient. The sample size estimates showed that a study utilizing PSTAPLE would require tens to hundreds less subjects than the other algorithms for detecting atrophy rates typically observed in brain disease.\nPSTAPLE is a useful tool for automatic human brain segmentation due to its precision and accuracy, which enable the detection of the size of the effect typically reported for neurological disorders with a substantially reduced sample size, in comparison to the other tools we assessed. This enables randomized controlled trials to be executed with reduced cost and duration, in turn, facilitating the assessment of new therapeutic interventions.",

We aimed to produced similar normative values for Desikan-Killianny-Tourville (DKT) and ex vivo-based labeling protocols, as well as examine the differences between these three atlases. Surfaces, thicknesses, and volumes of cortical regions were produced using cross-sectional magnetic resonance scans from the same 2713 healthy individuals aged 18-94 years as used in the reported DK norms. Models predicting regional cortical estimates of each hemisphere were produced using age, sex, estimated intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner manufacturer and magnetic field strength (MFS) as predictors. The DKT and DK models generally included the same predictors and produced similar R",

    "abstract": "The effect of T1 signal on FSL voxel-based morphometry modulated GM density and FreeSurfer cortical thickness is explored. The techniques rely on different analyses, but both are commonly used to detect spatial changes in GM. Standard pipelines show FSL voxel-based morphometry is sensitive to T1 signal alterations within a physiologic range, and results can appear discordant between FSL voxel-based morphometry and FreeSurfer cortical thickness. Care should be taken in extrapolating results to the effect on brain volume.",

    "abstract": "In structural magnetic resonance imaging motion artifacts are common, especially when not scanning healthy young adults. It has been shown that motion affects the analysis with automated image-processing techniques (e.g., FreeSurfer). This can bias results. Several developmental and adult studies have found reduced volume and thickness of gray matter due to motion artifacts. Thus, quality control is necessary in order to ensure an acceptable level of quality and to define exclusion criteria of images (i.e., determine participants with most severe artifacts). However, information about the quality control workflow and image exclusion procedure is largely lacking in the current literature and the existing rating systems differ. Here, we propose a stringent workflow of quality control steps during and after acquisition of T1-weighted images, which enables researchers dealing with populations that are typically affected by motion artifacts to enhance data quality and maximize sample sizes. As an underlying aim we established a thorough quality control rating system for T1-weighted images and applied it to the analysis of developmental clinical data using the automated processing pipeline FreeSurfer. This hands-on workflow and quality control rating system will aid researchers in minimizing motion artifacts in the final data set, and therefore enhance the quality of structural magnetic resonance imaging studies.",

The reproducibility of hippocampal atrophy rate for FSL/FIRST, AdaBoost, FreeSurfer, MAPS independently and MAPS combined with the boundary shift integral (MAPS-HBSI) were calculated. Back-to-back (BTB) 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE MRI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1) study at baseline and year one were used. Analysis on 3 groups of subjects was performed - 562 subjects at 1.5T, a 75 subject group that also had manual segmentation and 111 subjects at 3T. A simple and novel statistical test based on the binomial distribution was used that handled outlying data points robustly. Median hippocampal atrophy rates were -1.1%/year for healthy controls, -3.0%/year for mildly cognitively impaired and -5.1%/year for AD subjects. The best reproducibility was observed for MAPS-HBSI (1.3%), while the other methods tested had reproducibilities at least 50% higher at 1.5T and 3T which was statistically significant. For a clinical trial, MAPS-HBSI should require less than half the subjects of the other methods tested. All methods had good accuracy versus manual segmentation. The MAPS-HBSI method has substantially better reproducibility than the other methods considered.",

    "abstract": "Studies have found non-negligible differences in cortical thickness estimates across versions of software that are used for processing and quantifying MRI-based cortical measurements, and issues have arisen regarding these differences, as obtained estimates could potentially affect the validity of the results. However, more critical for diagnostic classification than absolute thickness estimates across versions is the inter-subject stability. We aimed to investigate the effect of change in software version on classification of older persons in groups of healthy, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease. Using MRI samples of 100 older normal controls, 100 with mild cognitive impairment and 100 Alzheimer's Disease patients obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, we performed a standard reconstruction processing using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite versions 4.1.0, 4.5.0 and 5.1.0. Pair-wise comparisons of cortical thickness between FreeSurfer versions revealed significant differences, ranging from 1.6% (4.1.0 vs. 4.5.0) to 5.8% (4.1.0 vs. 5.1.0) across the cortical mantle. However, change of version had very little effect on detectable differences in cortical thickness between diagnostic groups, and there were little differences in accuracy between versions when using entorhinal thickness for diagnostic classification. This lead us to conclude that differences in absolute thickness estimates across software versions in this case did not imply lacking validity, that classification results appeared reliable across software versions, and that classification results obtained in studies using different FreeSurfer versions can be reliably compared.

    "abstract": "The volumetric quantification of brain structures is of great interest in pediatric populations because it allows the investigation of different factors influencing neurodevelopment. FreeSurfer and FSL both provide frequently used packages for automatic segmentation of brain structures. In this study, we examined the accuracy and consistency of those two automated protocols relative to manual segmentation, commonly considered as the \"gold standard\" technique, for estimating hippocampus and amygdala volumes in a sample of preadolescent children aged between 6 to 11 years. The volumes obtained with FreeSurfer and FSL-FIRST were evaluated and compared with manual segmentations with respect to volume difference, spatial agreement and between- and within-method correlations. Results highlighted a tendency for both automated techniques to overestimate hippocampus and amygdala volumes, in comparison to manual segmentation. This was more pronounced when using FreeSurfer than FSL-FIRST and, for both techniques, the overestimation was more marked for the amygdala than the hippocampus. Pearson correlations support moderate associations between manual tracing and FreeSurfer for hippocampus (right r=0.69, p<0.001; left r=0.77, p<0.001) and amygdala (right r=0.61, p<0.001; left r=0.67, p<0.001) volumes. Correlation coefficients between manual segmentation and FSL-FIRST were statistically significant (right hippocampus r=0.59, p<0.001; left hippocampus r=0.51, p<0.001; right amygdala r=0.35, p<0.001; left amygdala r=0.31, p<0.001) but were significantly weaker, for all investigated structures. When computing intraclass correlation coefficients between manual tracing and automatic segmentation, all comparisons, except for left hippocampus volume estimated with FreeSurfer, failed to reach 0.70. When looking at each method separately, correlations between left and right hemispheric volumes showed strong associations between bilateral hippocampus and bilateral amygdala volumes when assessed using manual segmentation or FreeSurfer. These correlations were significantly weaker when volumes were assessed with FSL-FIRST. Finally, Bland-Altman plots suggest that the difference between manual and automatic segmentation might be influenced by the volume of the structure, because smaller volumes were associated with larger volume differences between techniques. These results demonstrate that, at least in a pediatric population, the agreement between amygdala and hippocampus volumes obtained with automated FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer protocols and those obtained with manual segmentation is not strong. Visual inspection by an informed individual and, if necessary, manual correction of automated segmentation outputs are important to ensure validity of volumetric results and interpretation of related findings.",

    "abstract": "This paper examined whether FreeSurfer-generated data differed between a fully-automated, unedited pipeline and an edited pipeline that included the application of control points to correct errors in white matter segmentation. In a sample of 30 individuals, we compared the summary statistics of surface area, white matter volumes, and cortical thickness derived from edited and unedited datasets for the 34 regions of interest (ROIs) that FreeSurfer (FS) generates. To determine whether applying control points would alter the detection of significant differences between patient and typical groups, effect sizes between edited and unedited conditions in individuals with the genetic disorder, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) were compared to neurotypical controls. Analyses were conducted with data that were generated from both a 1.5 tesla and a 3 tesla scanner. For 1.5 tesla data, mean area, volume, and thickness measures did not differ significantly between edited and unedited regions, with the exception of rostral anterior cingulate thickness, lateral orbitofrontal white matter, superior parietal white matter, and precentral gyral thickness. Results were similar for surface area and white matter volumes generated from the 3 tesla scanner. For cortical thickness measures however, seven edited ROI measures, primarily in frontal and temporal regions, differed significantly from their unedited counterparts, and three additional ROI measures approached significance. Mean effect sizes for edited ROIs did not differ from most unedited ROIs for either 1.5 or 3 tesla data. Taken together, these results suggest that although the application of control points may increase the validity of intensity normalization and, ultimately, segmentation, it may not affect the final, extracted metrics that FS generates. Potential exceptions to and limitations of these conclusions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare glucose metabolism and atrophy, in the precuneus and cingulate cortex, in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using FreeSurfer.\n47 individuals (17 patients with AD, 17 patients with amnestic MCI, and 13 healthy controls (HC)) were included. MRI and PET images using (18)F-FDG (mean injected dose of 185\u2009MBq) were acquired and analyzed using FreeSurfer to define regions of interest in the hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Regional volumes were generated. PET images were registered to the T1-weighted MRI images and regional uptake normalized by cerebellum uptake (SUVr) was measured.\nMean posterior cingulate volume was reduced in MCI and AD. SUVr were different between the three groups: mean precuneus SUVr was 1.02 for AD, 1.09 for MCI, and 1.26 for controls (p < 0.05); mean posterior cingulate SUVr was 0.96, 1.06, and 1.22 for AD, MCI, and controls, respectively (p < 0.05).\nWe found graduated hypometabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus in prodromal AD (MCI) and AD, whereas atrophy was not significant. This suggests that the use of (18)F-FDG in these two regions could be a neurodegenerative biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Automated segmentation of the amygdala and the hippocampus is of interest for research looking at large datasets where manual segmentation of T1-weighted magnetic resonance tomography images is less feasible for morphometric analysis. Manual segmentation still remains the gold standard for subcortical structures like the hippocampus and the amygdala. A direct comparison of VBM8 and Freesurfer is rarely done, because VBM8 results are most often used for voxel-based analysis. We used the same region-of-interest (ROI) for Freesurfer and VBM8 to relate automated and manually derived volumes of the amygdala and the hippocampus. We processed a large manually segmented dataset of n=92 independent samples with an automated segmentation strategy (VBM8 vs. Freesurfer Version 5.0). For statistical analysis, we only calculated Pearsons's correlation coefficients, but used methods developed for comparison such as Lin's concordance coefficient. The correlation between automatic and manual segmentation was high for the hippocampus [0.58-0.76] and lower for the amygdala [0.45-0.59]. However, concordance coefficients point to higher concordance for the amygdala [0.46-0.62] instead of the hippocampus [0.06-0.12]. VBM8 and Freesurfer segmentation performed on a comparable level in comparison to manual segmentation. We conclude (1) that correlation alone does not capture systematic differences (e.g. of hippocampal volumes), (2) calculation of ROI volumes with VBM8 gives measurements comparable to Freesurfer V5.0 when using the same ROI and (3) systematic and proportional differences are caused mainly by different definitions of anatomic boundaries and only to a lesser part by different segmentation strategies. This work underscores the importance of using method comparison techniques and demonstrates that even with high correlation coefficients, there can be still large differences in absolute volume.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, many studies have used automated processes to analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data such as cortical thickness, which is one indicator of neuronal health. Due to the convenience of image processing software (e.g., FreeSurfer), standard practice is to rely on automated results without performing visual inspection of intermediate processing. In this work, structural MRIs of 40 healthy controls who were scanned twice were used to determine the test-retest reliability of FreeSurfer-derived cortical measures in four groups of subjects-those 25 that passed visual inspection (approved), those 15 that failed visual inspection (disapproved), a combined group, and a subset of 10 subjects (Travel) whose test and retest scans occurred at different sites. Test-retest correlation (TRC), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and percent difference (PD) were used to measure the reliability in the Destrieux and Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlases. In the approved subjects, reliability of cortical thickness/surface area/volume (DK atlas only) were: TRC (0.82/0.88/0.88), ICC (0.81/0.87/0.88), PD (0.86/1.19/1.39), which represent a significant improvement over these measures when disapproved subjects are included. Travel subjects' results show that cortical thickness reliability is more sensitive to site differences than the cortical surface area and volume. To determine the effect of visual inspection on sample size required for studies of MRI-derived cortical thickness, the number of subjects required to show group differences was calculated. Significant differences observed across imaging sites, between visually approved/disapproved subjects, and across regions with different sizes suggest that these measures should be used with caution.",

    "abstract": "Up to 50% of all patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from anxiety symptoms, a much higher percentage than in the general population. This suggests that PD associated pathological alterations partly underlie these symptoms, although empirical evidence is limited.\nHere we investigated the association between anxiety symptoms measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and hippocampal and amygdalar volume in 110 early-stage patients with PD. Measures of anxiety in PD are often obscured by overlap with the somatic symptoms. We therefore also used a subscale of the BAI, established by our recent factor analysis, that reflects 'psychological' anxiety symptoms and is independent of the severity of PD-related motor and autonomic symptoms. We used FreeSurfer and voxel-based morphometry for the volumetric analyses.\nBoth software packages showed a negative correlation between the 'psychological' subscale of the BAI, but not total BAI and volume of the left amygdala, independent of the severity of motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction and dopaminergic or anxiolytic medication status.\nThese results confirm studies in non-PD samples showing lower left amygdalar volume in anxious patients. The results also indicate that the 'psychological' BAI subscale is a better reflection of neural correlates of anxiety in PD. Whether the left amygdalar volume decrease constitutes a premorbid trait, a PD-associated neurobiological susceptibility to anxiety or arises as a consequence of chronic anxiety symptoms remains to be determined by future prospective longitudinal studies. Nonetheless, we speculate that the Parkinson pathology is responsible for the reduction in amygdalar volume and the concomitant development of anxiety symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease-related pathology results in tremendous structural and functional changes in the brain. These morphological changes might lead to a less precise performance of automated brain segmentation techniques in AD-patients, which in turn could possibly lead to false allocations of gray matter, white matter or cerebrospinal fluid. FreeSurfer has been shown to operate as an accurate and reliable instrument to measure cortical thickness and volume of neuroanatomical structures. Considering the principal role of FreeSurfer in the imaging field of AD, the present study aims to investigate the robustness of FreeSurfer to capture morphological changes in the brain against varying processing variables in comparison to manual measurements (the gold standard). T1-weighted MRI scan data were used pertaining to a sample of 53 individuals (18 healthy participants, 18 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 18 patients with mild AD). Data were analyzed with different FreeSurfer versions (v4.3.1, v4.5.0, v5.0.0, v5.1.0), on a custom-built cluster (LINUX) and a Macintosh (UNIX) workstation. Group differences across versions and workstations were most consistent for both the hippocampus and posterior cingulate, regions known to be affected in the earliest stages of the disease. The results showed that later versions of FreeSurfer were more sensitive to identify group differences and corresponded best with the results of gold standard manual volumetric methods. In conclusion, later versions of FreeSurfer were more accurate than earlier versions, especially in medial temporal and posterior parietal regions. This development is very promising for future applications of FreeSurfer in research studies and encourages the future role of FreeSurfer output as a candidate marker in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "FreeSurfer is a tool to quantify cortical and subcortical brain anatomy automatically and noninvasively. Previous studies have reported reliability and statistical power analyses in relatively small samples or only selected one aspect of brain anatomy. Here, we investigated reliability and statistical power of cortical thickness, surface area, volume, and the volume of subcortical structures in a large sample (N=189) of healthy elderly subjects (64+ years). Reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) of cortical and subcortical parameters is generally high (cortical: ICCs>0.87, subcortical: ICCs>0.95). Surface-based smoothing increases reliability of cortical thickness maps, while it decreases reliability of cortical surface area and volume. Nevertheless, statistical power of all measures benefits from smoothing. When aiming to detect a 10% difference between groups, the number of subjects required to test effects with sufficient power over the entire cortex varies between cortical measures (cortical thickness: N=39, surface area: N=21, volume: N=81; 10mm smoothing, power=0.8, \u03b1=0.05). For subcortical regions this number is between 16 and 76 subjects, depending on the region. We also demonstrate the advantage of within-subject designs over between-subject designs. Furthermore, we publicly provide a tool that allows researchers to perform a priori power analysis and sensitivity analysis to help evaluate previously published studies and to design future studies with sufficient statistical power.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is widely studied with neuroimaging techniques given its importance in learning and memory and its potential as a biomarker for brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. However, its complex folding anatomy often presents analytical challenges. In particular, the critical hippocampal subfield information is usually ignored by hippocampal registration in detailed morphometric studies. Such an approach is thus inadequate to accurately characterize hippocampal morphometry and effectively identify hippocampal structural changes related to different conditions. To bridge this gap, we present our initial effort towards building a computational framework for subfield-guided hippocampal morphometry. This initial effort is focused on surface-based morphometry and aims to build a surface atlas of hippocampal subfields. Using the FreeSurfer software package, we obtain valuable hippocampal subfield information. Using the FIRST software package, we extract reliable hippocampal surface information. Using SPHARM, we develop an approach to create an atlas by mapping interpolated subfield information onto an average surface. The empirical result using ADNI data demonstrates the promise and good reproducibility of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Growing interest has developed in hippocampal subfield volumetry over the past few years and an increasing number of studies use the automatic segmentation algorithm implemented in FreeSurfer. However, this approach has not been validated on standard resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) as used in most studies. We aimed at comparing hippocampal subfield segmentation using FreeSurfer on standard T1-weighted images versus manual delineation on dedicated high-resolution hippocampal scans. Hippocampal subfields were segmented in 133 individuals including 98 cognitively normal controls aged 19-84 years, 17 mild cognitive impairment and 18 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using both methods. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were computed to assess the consistency between both methods, and the effects of age and diagnosis were assessed from both measures. Low to moderate ICC (0.31-0.74) were found for the subiculum and other subfields as well as for the whole hippocampus, and the correlations were very low for cornu ammonis (CA)1 (<0.1). FreeSurfer CA1 volume estimates were found to be much lower than those obtained from manual segmentation, and this bias was proportional to the volume of this structure so that no effect of age or AD could be detected on FreeSurfer CA1 volumes. This study points to the differences in the anatomic definition of the subfields between FreeSurfer and manual delineation, especially for CA1, and provides clue for improvement of this automatic technique for potential clinical application on standard T1-weighted MR.",

    "abstract": "Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.",

    "abstract": "FreeSurfer software package automatically estimates the cerebral cortical thickness. Its use is widely accepted, albeit this tool was validated against histologic measurements in only two post-mortem isolated brain MR scans. Indeed, a comparison between histologic measurements and FreeSurfer estimation from in vivo data was never performed. At the \"Claudio Munari\" Center for Epilepsy and Parkinson Surgery we have included FreeSurfer in our presurgical workflow since 2008, mainly because the automatic reconstruction of the brain surface is useful for carefully planning the surgical resection. We therefore compared cortical thickness values obtained by the automatic software pipeline with manual histologic measurements performed on 27 histologic specimens resected from the corresponding brain regions of the same epileptic subjects. This method-comparison study, including Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman plot analysis, showed a good agreement between FreeSurfer estimation and histologic measurements of cortical thickness. The mean cortical thickness values (\u00b1Standard Deviation) obtained with FreeSurfer and histologic measurements were 3.65\u00a0mm\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44 and 3.72\u00a0mm\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36, respectively (P value\u2009=\u20090.32). Our findings strengthen previous reports on cortical thickness changes as biomarkers of different neurological conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study examined hippocampal volume as a putative biomarker for psychotic illness in the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) psychosis sample, contrasting manual tracing and semiautomated (FreeSurfer) region-of-interest outcomes. The study sample (n = 596) included probands with schizophrenia (SZ, n = 71), schizoaffective disorder (SAD, n = 70), and psychotic bipolar I disorder (BDP, n = 86); their first-degree relatives (SZ-Rel, n = 74; SAD-Rel, n = 62; BDP-Rel, n = 88); and healthy controls (HC, n = 145). Hippocampal volumes were derived from 3Tesla T1-weighted MPRAGE images using manual tracing/3DSlicer3.6.3 and semiautomated parcellation/FreeSurfer5.1,64bit. Volumetric outcomes from both methodologies were contrasted in HC and probands and relatives across the 3 diagnoses, using mixed-effect regression models (SAS9.3 Proc MIXED); Pearson correlations between manual tracing and FreeSurfer outcomes were computed. SZ (P = .0007-.02) and SAD (P = .003-.14) had lower hippocampal volumes compared with HC, whereas BDP showed normal volumes bilaterally (P = .18-.55). All relative groups had hippocampal volumes not different from controls (P = .12-.97) and higher than those observed in probands (P = .003-.09), except for FreeSurfer measures in bipolar probands vs relatives (P = .64-.99). Outcomes from manual tracing and FreeSurfer showed direct, moderate to strong, correlations (r = .51-.73, P < .05). These findings from a large psychosis sample support decreased hippocampal volume as a putative biomarker for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, but not for psychotic bipolar I disorder, and may reflect a cumulative effect of divergent primary disease processes and/or lifetime medication use. Manual tracing and semiautomated parcellation regional volumetric approaches may provide useful outcomes for defining measurable biomarkers underlying severe mental illness.",

    "abstract": "To measure hippocampal volume change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), expert manual delineation is often used because of its supposed accuracy. It has been suggested that expert outlining yields poorer reproducibility as compared to automated methods, but this has not been investigated.\nTo determine the reproducibilities of expert manual outlining and two common automated methods for measuring hippocampal atrophy rates in healthy aging, MCI and AD.\nFrom the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 80 subjects were selected: 20 patients with AD, 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Left and right hippocampal volume change between baseline and month-12 visit was assessed by using expert manual delineation, and by the automated software packages FreeSurfer (longitudinal processing stream) and FIRST. To assess reproducibility of the measured hippocampal volume change, both back-to-back (BTB) MPRAGE scans available for each visit were analyzed. Hippocampal volume change was expressed in \u03bcL, and as a percentage of baseline volume. Reproducibility of the 1-year hippocampal volume change was estimated from the BTB measurements by using linear mixed model to calculate the limits of agreement (LoA) of each method, reflecting its measurement uncertainty. Using the delta method, approximate p-values were calculated for the pairwise comparisons between methods. Statistical analyses were performed both with inclusion and exclusion of visibly incorrect segmentations.\nVisibly incorrect automated segmentation in either one or both scans of a longitudinal scan pair occurred in 7.5% of the hippocampi for FreeSurfer and in 6.9% of the hippocampi for FIRST. After excluding these failed cases, reproducibility analysis for 1-year percentage volume change yielded LoA of \u00b17.2% for FreeSurfer, \u00b19.7% for expert manual delineation, and \u00b110.0% for FIRST. Methods ranked the same for reproducibility of 1-year \u03bcL volume change, with LoA of \u00b1218 \u03bcL for FreeSurfer, \u00b1319 \u03bcL for expert manual delineation, and \u00b1333 \u03bcL for FIRST. Approximate p-values indicated that reproducibility was better for FreeSurfer than for manual or FIRST, and that manual and FIRST did not differ. Inclusion of failed automated segmentations led to worsening of reproducibility of both automated methods for 1-year raw and percentage volume change.\nQuantitative reproducibility values of 1-year microliter and percentage hippocampal volume change were roughly similar between expert manual outlining, FIRST and FreeSurfer, but FreeSurfer reproducibility was statistically significantly superior to both manual outlining and FIRST after exclusion of failed segmentations.",

    "abstract": "A scheme to significantly speed up the processing of MRI with FreeSurfer (FS) is presented. The scheme is aimed at maximizing the productivity (number of subjects processed per unit time) for the use case of research projects with datasets involving many acquisitions. The scheme combines the already existing GPU-accelerated version of the FS workflow with a task-level parallel scheme supervised by a resource scheduler. This allows for an optimum utilization of the computational power of a given hardware platform while avoiding problems with shortages of platform resources. The scheme can be executed on a wide variety of platforms, as its implementation only involves the script that orchestrates the execution of the workflow components and the FS code itself requires no modifications. The scheme has been implemented and tested on a commodity platform within the reach of most research groups (a personal computer with four cores and an NVIDIA GeForce 480 GTX graphics card). Using the scheduled task-level parallel scheme, a productivity above 0.6 subjects per hour is achieved on the test platform, corresponding to a speedup of over six times compared to the default CPU-only serial FS workflow.",

    "abstract": "In vivo quantification of \u03b2-amyloid deposition using positron emission tomography is emerging as an important procedure for the early diagnosis of the Alzheimer's disease and is likely to play an important role in upcoming clinical trials of disease modifying agents. However, many groups use manually defined regions, which are non-standard across imaging centers. Analyses often are limited to a handful of regions because of the labor-intensive nature of manual region drawing. In this study, we developed an automatic image quantification protocol based on FreeSurfer, an automated whole brain segmentation tool, for quantitative analysis of amyloid images. Standard manual tracing and FreeSurfer-based analyses were performed in 77 participants including 67 cognitively normal individuals and 10 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease. The manual and FreeSurfer approaches yielded nearly identical estimates of amyloid burden (intraclass correlation = 0.98) as assessed by the mean cortical binding potential. An MRI test-retest study demonstrated excellent reliability of FreeSurfer based regional amyloid burden measurements. The FreeSurfer-based analysis also revealed that the majority of cerebral cortical regions accumulate amyloid in parallel, with slope of accumulation being the primary difference between regions.",

    "abstract": "FreeSurfer is a popular software package to measure cortical thickness and volume of neuroanatomical structures. However, little if any is known about measurement reliability across various data processing conditions. Using a set of 30 anatomical T1-weighted 3T MRI scans, we investigated the effects of data processing variables such as FreeSurfer version (v4.3.1, v4.5.0, and v5.0.0), workstation (Macintosh and Hewlett-Packard), and Macintosh operating system version (OSX 10.5 and OSX 10.6). Significant differences were revealed between FreeSurfer version v5.0.0 and the two earlier versions. These differences were on average 8.8 \u00b1 6.6% (range 1.3-64.0%) (volume) and 2.8 \u00b1 1.3% (1.1-7.7%) (cortical thickness). About a factor two smaller differences were detected between Macintosh and Hewlett-Packard workstations and between OSX 10.5 and OSX 10.6. The observed differences are similar in magnitude as effect sizes reported in accuracy evaluations and neurodegenerative studies.The main conclusion is that in the context of an ongoing study, users are discouraged to update to a new major release of either FreeSurfer or operating system or to switch to a different type of workstation without repeating the analysis; results thus give a quantitative support to successive recommendations stated by FreeSurfer developers over the years. Moreover, in view of the large and significant cross-version differences, it is concluded that formal assessment of the accuracy of FreeSurfer is desirable.",

    "abstract": "Freely available automated MR image analysis techniques are being increasingly used to investigate neuroanatomical abnormalities in patients with neurological disorders. It is important to assess the specificity and validity of automated measurements of structure volumes with respect to reliable manual methods that rely on human anatomical expertise. The thalamus is widely investigated in many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders using MRI, but thalamic volumes are notoriously difficult to quantify given the poor between-tissue contrast at the thalamic gray-white matter interface. In the present study we investigated the reliability of automatically determined thalamic volume measurements obtained using FreeSurfer software with respect to a manual stereological technique on 3D T1-weighted MR images obtained from a 3 T MR system. Further to demonstrating impressive consistency between stereological and FreeSurfer volume estimates of the thalamus in healthy subjects and neurological patients, we demonstrate that the extent of agreeability between stereology and FreeSurfer is equal to the agreeability between two human anatomists estimating thalamic volume using stereological methods. Using patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy as a model for thalamic atrophy, we also show that both automated and manual methods provide very similar ratios of thalamic volume loss in patients. This work promotes the use of FreeSurfer for reliable estimation of global volume in healthy and diseased thalami.",

    "abstract": "Cortical surface mapping has been widely used to compensate for individual variability of cortical shape and topology in anatomical and functional studies. While many surface mapping methods were proposed based on landmarks, curves, spherical or native cortical coordinates, few studies have extensively and quantitatively evaluated surface mapping methods across different methodologies. In this study we compared five cortical surface mapping algorithms, including large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) for curves (LDDMM-curve), for surfaces (LDDMM-surface), multi-manifold LDDMM (MM-LDDMM), FreeSurfer, and CARET, using 40 MRI scans and 10 simulated datasets. We computed curve variation errors and surface alignment consistency for assessing the mapping accuracy of local cortical features (e.g., gyral/sulcal curves and sulcal regions) and the curvature correlation for measuring the mapping accuracy in terms of overall cortical shape. In addition, the simulated datasets facilitated the investigation of mapping error distribution over the cortical surface when the MM-LDDMM, FreeSurfer, and CARET mapping algorithms were applied. Our results revealed that the LDDMM-curve, MM-LDDMM, and CARET approaches best aligned the local curve features with their own curves. The MM-LDDMM approach was also found to be the best in aligning the local regions and cortical folding patterns (e.g., curvature) as compared to the other mapping approaches. The simulation experiment showed that the MM-LDDMM mapping yielded less local and global deformation errors than the CARET and FreeSurfer mappings.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal volume is reduced in Alzheimer Disease (AD) and has been proposed as a possible surrogate biomarker to aid early diagnosis. Whilst automated methods to segment the hippocampus from magnetic resonance images are available, manual segmentation, in spite of being time-consuming and unsuitable for large samples, is still the standard. In order to study the validity of FreeSurfer's automated method, we compared hippocampal automated measures with manual tracing in a sample composed of healthy elderly (N=41), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (N=23), and AD (N=25) subjects. Percent volume overlap, percent volume difference, correlations, and Bland-Altman plots were studied. Automated measures were slightly larger than hand tracing ones (mean difference 10%). Percent volume overlap showed good results, but was far from perfect (78%). Manual and automated volume correlations were approximately 0.84 and the Bland-Altman analysis showed acceptable interchangeability of methods. Within-group analysis demonstrated that patient samples obtained smaller values in validity indexes than controls. Globally, FreeSurfer's automated hippocampal volumetry showed adequate validity when compared to manual tracing, with a tendency to overestimation. Nevertheless, the greater difference between automated and manual segmentation in atrophic brains suggests that studies in AD based on this software could be more likely to produce false negatives.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and semantic dementia (SD) are characterized by different patterns of global and temporal lobe atrophy which can be studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Manual delineation of regions of interest is time-consuming. FreeSurfer is a freely available automated technique which has a facility to label cortical and subcortical brain regions automatically. As with all automated techniques comparison with existing methods is important. Eight temporal lobe structures in each hemisphere were delineated using FreeSurfer and compared with manual segmentations in 10 control, 10 AD, and 10 SD subjects. The reproducibility errors for the manual segmentations ranged from 3% to 6%. Differences in protocols between the two methods led to differences in absolute volumes with the greatest differences between methods found bilaterally in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and fusiform gyrus (p<0.005). However, good correlations between the methods were found for most regions, with the highest correlations shown for the ventricles, whole brain and left medial-inferior temporal gyrus (r>0.9), followed by the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus, left superior temporal gyrus, right medial-inferior temporal gyrus and left temporal lobe (r>0.8). Overlap ratios differed between methods bilaterally in the amygdala, superior temporal gyrus, temporal lobe, left fusiform gyrus and right parahippocampal gyrus (p<0.01). Despite differences in protocol and volumes, both methods showed similar atrophy patterns in the patient groups compared with controls, and similar right-left differences, suggesting that both methods accurately distinguish between the three groups.",

    "abstract": "Fully-automated brain segmentation methods have not been widely adopted for clinical use because of issues related to reliability, accuracy, and limitations of delineation protocol. By combining the probabilistic-based FreeSurfer (FS) method with the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)-based label-propagation method, we are able to increase reliability and accuracy, and allow for flexibility in template choice. Our method uses the automated FreeSurfer subcortical labeling to provide a coarse-to-fine introduction of information in the LDDMM template-based segmentation resulting in a fully-automated subcortical brain segmentation method (FS+LDDMM). One major advantage of the FS+LDDMM-based approach is that the automatically generated segmentations generated are inherently smooth, thus subsequent steps in shape analysis can directly follow without manual post-processing or loss of detail. We have evaluated our new FS+LDDMM method on several databases containing a total of 50 subjects with different pathologies, scan sequences and manual delineation protocols for labeling the basal ganglia, thalamus, and hippocampus. In healthy controls we report Dice overlap measures of 0.81, 0.83, 0.74, 0.86 and 0.75 for the right caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, thalamus and hippocampus respectively. We also find statistically significant improvement of accuracy in FS+LDDMM over FreeSurfer for the caudate nucleus and putamen of Huntington's disease and Tourette's syndrome subjects, and the right hippocampus of Schizophrenia subjects.",

    "abstract": "To validate the usefulness of the packages available for automated hippocampal volumetry, we measured hippocampal volumes using one manual and two recently developed automated volumetric methods.\nThe study included T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 21 patients with chronic major depressive disorder (MDD) and 20 normal controls. Using coronal turbo field echo (TFE) MRI with a slice thickness of 1.3 mm, the hippocampal volumes were measured using three methods: manual volumetry, surface-based parcellation using FreeSurfer, and individual atlas-based volumetry using IBASPM. In addition, the intracranial cavity volume (ICV) was measured manually.\nThe absolute left hippocampal volume of the patients with MDD measured using all three methods was significantly smaller than the left hippocampal volume of the normal controls (manual P = 0.029, FreeSurfer P = 0.035, IBASPM P = 0.018). After controlling for the ICV, except for the right hippocampal volume measured using FreeSurfer, both measured hippocampal volumes of the patients with MDD were significantly smaller than the measured hippocampal volumes of the normal controls (right manual P = 0.019, IBASPM P = 0.012; left manual P = 0.003, FreeSurfer P = 0.010, IBASPM P = 0.002),. In the intrarater reliability test, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were all excellent (manual right 0.947, left 0.934; FreeSurfer right 1.000, left 1.000; IBASPM right 1.000, left 1.000). In the test of agreement between the volumetric methods, the ICCs were right 0.846 and left 0.848 (manual and FreeSurfer), and right 0.654 and left 0.717 (manual and IBASPM).\nThe automated hippocampal volumetric methods showed good agreement with manual hippocampal volumetry, but the volume measured using FreeSurfer was 35% larger and the agreement was questionable with IBASPM. Although the automated methods could detect hippocampal atrophy in the patients with MDD, the results indicate that manual hippocampal volumetry is still the gold standard, while the automated volumetric methods need to be improved.",
